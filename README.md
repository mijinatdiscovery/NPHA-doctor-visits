# Number of Doctor Visits Prediction


## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model using a machine learning algorithm to predict the number of doctor visits for patients aged 50 and older, categorizing these visits into predefined groups {1: 0-1 doctors, 2: 2-3 doctors, 3: 4 or more doctors } based on their physical, mental, and dental health status along with other lifestyle factors.

Our dataset for training includes 714 seniors, encompassing variables such as health status, demographics, and lifestyle factors. Despite achieving a cross-validation accuracy of about 63.9%, the model's performance on unseen data was lower, at 41%, highlighting a need for further enhancements to ensure reliability in practical settings.

An important limitation to address is the imbalance in the 'race' feature within our dataset, coupled with the absence of 'age' as a considered factor, which could significantly impact the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy. Collecting more comprehensive data, including a broader demographic spread and additional age-related information, will be crucial in refining the model's effectiveness.


This tool aims to support healthcare planners and providers in optimizing the allocation of resources by forecasting healthcare demand variably across different patient groups. The model requires additional development to improve its accuracy and reliability for deployment in real-world healthcare scenarios.


## DATA
This model was trained on a subset of [the National Poll on Healthy Aging (NPHA) dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/936/national+poll+on+healthy+aging+(npha)), consisting of 714 records of seniors who responded to the NPHA survey. The features include 14 attributes related to health and sleep. There is information about race/ethnicity, gender, and age.


## MODEL 
We have trained a Random Forest classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVC), DecisionTree. 

Both RandomForest and SVC are capable of managing the high dimensionality inherent in the dataset, which includes a diverse range of variables from healthcare usage to lifestyle factors. 

In initial tests, the Random Forest model performed better compared to the other models.

Average Accuracy: 60.55% (reported as higher, but confusion matrix suggests lower effective accuracy)
Reported Accuracy: 41% as the effective accuracy, which reflects the proportion of total correct predictions across all classes.


## HYPERPARAMETER OPTIMSATION
We used BayesSearchCV to obtain the best parameters for the RandomFoestClassifier, SVC models.
Both RandomForest and SVC models demonstrated strong predictive accuracy and robustness.


**RandomFoestClassifier Best Hyperparameters**

n_estimators: 200

max_depth: 15

min_samples_split: 2

min_samples_leaf: 3

bootstrap: False

n_iter: 100

**SVC Best Hyperparameters**

C: 14.107513230637315

gamma: 10

kernel: rbf

n_iter: 100

When tuning hyperparameters for RandomFoestClassifier, there was a significant difference between the training score(0.65) and the test score(0.38). But as the value of the parameter increases, the difference between the train score and the test score decreased.

When tuning hyperparameters for SVC, particularly with the inclusion of the polynomial kernel (poly), computational time increased significantly.


## RESULTS
RandomForest, SVC (Support Vector Classifier) has the highest training score. In terms of test accuracy, RandomForest again slightly outperforms the other models but all are fairly close. 

In the precision, recall, and f1 scores, RandomForest generally shows balanced performance across classes but struggles with Class 1. SVC shows slightly better performance for Class 2, which is the majority class, it might be better at identifying more common scenarios.

SVC might offer better performance for the specific task but **RandomForest** would be a strong choice on the grounds of interpretability, computational efficiency, and **more balanced class performance**. These factors are crucial in healthcare applications.
